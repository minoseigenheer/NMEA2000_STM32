# NMEA2000_STM32 CAN library

Designed for STM32F105 CAN gateway.
[https://github.com/minoseigenheer/STM32_NMEA2000_CAN_gateway](https://github.com/minoseigenheer/STM32_CAN_gateway)
Might also works with F103 / F107 / F405 / F407... and other STM32 MCU's with integrated bxCAN controller.


### To use this library, you will also need:
  - NMEA2000 library https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000
  - STM32_CAN library https://github.com/minoseigenheer/STM32_CAN
  - STM32 HAL for your MCU

### Examples
- [STM32CubeIDE NMEA2000 battery project example](https://github.com/minoseigenheer/STM32_NMEA2000_CAN_gateway/tree/main/STM32CubeIDE%20NMEA2000%20battery%20example)
  > Import project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace

### STM23CubeIDE setup 
If you are not very experienced with STM23CubeIDE this guide can help to configure a project for your own STM32 based hardware.
**I recommend start with this [example](https://github.com/BitterAndReal/STM32_NMEA2000_CAN_gateway/tree/main/STM32CubeIDE%20NMEA2000%20battery%20example)**
  - Create a STM32 C++ project in STM23CubeIDE
  - Select your MCU which will add the correct HAL to your project.
  - We can not directly call C++ from the main.c
    > Create your own application.cpp & application.hpp files with your C++ project setup() and loop() which are called from with extern "C" {...
    > From there you can include "NMEA2000.h" & "NMEA2000_STM32.hpp" & "STM32_CAN.hpp" and call the NMEA2000 methods. 
  - In Cube MX configure external clock settings of your MCU. 
    > CAN bus needs an external clock source!
  - Activate the CAN bus you want to use.
  - Enable the CAN RX1 interrupt in the NVIC settings
  - Enable the CAN TX interrupt in the NVIC settings
  - Copy the NMEA2000 and NMEA_STM32 library's to your "Libs" folder of your STM32Cube project 
    **or use linked git submodules**.
    ```
    // Use the following git commands to add submodules
    cd YourProjectRepo/Libs
    git submodule add https://github.com/ttlappalainen/NMEA2000
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    git submodule add https://github.com/BitterAndReal/NMEA2000_STM32
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    git submodule add https://github.com/BitterAndReal/STM32_CAN
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    // and update them with 
    git pull --recurse-submodules
    git submodule update --remote --recursive
    ```
  - Add the library folders to the G++ compiler include paths:
    > - Select your project in the Project Explorer.
    > - go to: File > Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > MCU G++ Compiler > Include paths
    > - Add the NMEA2000 and NMEA_STM32 library folders to the included paths
  - If you want to use the CAN init of the library, which sets the CAN baud rate and filters, disable the STM32CubeIDE generated code.
    > Navigate to “Project Manager” > “Advanced Settings” find MX_CAN#_Init” 
    > and enable “Do Not Generate Function Call”.
  - By default, the peripheral MSP initialization function HAL_CAN_MspInit (in stm32xxx_hal_msp.c) is automatically called and takes care of the configuration of the CAN_RX/TX GPIOs, enabling of the peripheral clock and enabling of the CAN interrupts
